# Secret key

# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration

#db.default.url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/tt_dev_pg"
#db.default.user="tt_dev_usr"
#db.default.password="ttdevpw"

# Heroku Postgres DB
